1.Basically .env files are developed inorder to store confidential values like the api keys,dbms passwds etc.
2.api key allows the user to access the google cloud services and make sure it is valid only for authorised user
3.load_dotenv() is for reading the dotenv file(i.e fetching the api key residing in .env file)
4.os.getenv() is used to store variable api_key as the exact value of api key we have stored in .env file.
5.genai.configure(api_key=api_key) :- since we are using genai model of google,hence api key is mandatory to pass the api request and hence i modify the api_key required for genai model to the api key we stored in .env file.
6.Next we define a variable model,stating which model of the google genai to use and we here use gemini flash 1.5 model.
7.we define a function to extract the text from the image from pre trained model by passing the image_path,output_folder where image_path->path of the image to fetch,output_folder->stores the extracted text in json format.
8.input_prompt is defined with multistring input and hence use triple quotes and define what are the parameters to include in the model to fetch.
9.we create a try catch block and define variable 'image' as Image.open()->opens the img available in the image_path.
10.we create a response variable and store model.generate_content->to generate content based on input prompt and we pass the paramenter of input_prompt and image inside it.
11. now response.text.strip()->after we get the raw data in json format is stored in response,.text->converts the raw json data to string,.strip("'''json")->it removes the trailing '''json text from the response and this data is stored in cheque_data.
12.json_path=os.path.join()->combines all json files together and input parameter is output_folder where all the extracted json data is stored as chequeno.json
13.opening the json_path and we overwrite the content with 2 indent spaces in json.dump() function and hence we get the extracted json file in multiplestring with 2 spaces and if any error occurs then error is displayed.
